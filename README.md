# CI-CD-Pipeline-with-AWS

 I have designed and implemented a robust CI/CD pipeline that utilizes Amazon Web Services (AWS) tools to ensure efficient and automated software delivery. The pipeline is built using CodeCommit for version control, CodeBuild for continuous integration, and an S3 bucket for artifact storage. The target environment for deployment is the Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK) platform, and the pipeline incorporates a canary deployment strategy to minimize risk during the deployment process.

By implementing this pipeline, I have streamlined the software delivery process, reducing the time and effort required to deploy new updates to the application. The pipeline provides a standardized, automated process that ensures consistency and reliability across all deployments.
